If you are considering entering the amazing world of technical writing, you might want to check out this first. When I first became a technical writer, I thought most of my time would be spent working in quiet solitude. I imagined it was the ideal job for an introvert, who preferred dealing with the screen over networking and communicating with multiple departments and stakeholders. How wrong I was. Over the last six years, my typical day involves a lot of cross-department collaboration and meetings with various stakeholders.

The more senior a technical writer becomes, the more meetings you have to attend. Now, I get you. Meetings can be time-consuming and take time away from writing. But meetings are necessary when you are a technical writer. The meetings are required to clarify requirements from stakeholders, to improve understanding of technical details by talking to subject matter experts (SMEs), and more. You will find most of your day involves cross-department communications. Writing only comprises about 20% of a technical writer’s job.

So the following is an outline of what my typical day looks like for a technical writer at a hardware or software company:

1. Check emails for important notices and meetings.
2. Check project management software for assigned tasks.
3. Attend any scheduled meetings.
4. Address assigned tasks during free time.
5. Submit any completed drafts for SMEs and stakeholders to review.
6. Publish approved drafts to online platforms through the backend.

**Note:**
Based on the company, some companies will schedule meetings on the day or with very short notice. Meetings can last anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours depending on how difficult the context is, so be flexible with your schedule.

{: .box-tip}
**Tip:** 
When writing, you will probably have many online discussions with stakeholders or subject matter experts (SMEs) to clarify what they mean and to check that you understand what they are trying to convey correctly. If your question can't be answered via text messages, it’s better to schedule a meeting with the stakeholders or SMEs to discuss the issues.

So there you have it, that’s what a typical day may look like for a technical writer.
