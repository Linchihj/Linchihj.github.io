### My story

I started my career as a translator and reporting editor in Taiwan’s media sector during the first seven years of my career before accidentally landing a job in the technology sector. In 2017, I was supposed to be working on a marketing content project at CSOFT International based in Shanghai, China, but there weren’t any marketing projects available. So I bravely volunteered to work on their Alibaba Cloud project. Little did I know what I was getting myself into.

Since then it has been a long learning process of understanding difficult technical concepts, coding, and various technical terms. Patiently communicating and collaborating with designers, product managers, marketing directors, and engineers to generate high-quality help documentation.

Through solving many different challenges, I now truly enjoy technical writing. I’m interested in further advancing my career in documenting SaaS applications and open-source software. I find software documentation challenging but at the same time rewarding when difficult concepts are transformed into easy-to-understand information.

I have a record of switching from one field to another and quickly picking up required skills as demonstrated from my education trajectory. My undergraduate background is in English literature from one of Taiwan’s most reputable universities, National Tsing Hua University (NTHU). After graduating from NTHU, I continued further studies in the UK and majored in International Relations and East Asian studies for my master's degree.

Identifying as a global nomad, I grew up in several different countries and loved to learn about other people’s cultures and customs from a young age. This is especially helpful when working in multicultural environments, where I tend to adapt quickly. Because I’ve lived abroad for 18 years, I’m bilingual and business fluent in Chinese and English.

In my spare time, I try to hone my knowledge about best documentation practices, polish coding skills (especially front-end related), and draw illustrations. I enjoy the process of creating text and visual content.
