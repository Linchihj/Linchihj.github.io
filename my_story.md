### My story

At the start of my career, I was a translator and reporting editor in Taiwan’s media sector for seven years before accidentally landing a job in the technology sector. In 2017, I decided to move to Shanghai, China. I  applied for a marketing content project at *CSOFT International* based in Shanghai, China, but once I got there no marketing projects were available. So I bravely volunteered to work on their Alibaba Cloud project. Little did I know what I was getting myself into.

I was immediately thrown into the deep end of cloud technology and was on a cloud platform crash course, learning about various database technologies, big data, and data visualization. I was introduced to basic user interface (UI) string and API documentation edits in Shanghai. Since then it has been a long learning process of understanding difficult technical concepts, coding, and various technical terms. Patiently communicating and collaborating with designers, product managers, marketing directors, and engineers to create high-quality help documentation. Sometimes, I get to work and collaborate with a team of writers. Other times I find myself to be the only writer in the company, who is responsible for laying the technical writing foundation and workflows.

Through solving many different challenges, I now truly enjoy technical writing. I’m interested in further advancing my career in documenting SaaS applications and open-source software. I find software documentation challenging but at the same time rewarding when difficult concepts are transformed into easy-to-understand information. It is also rewarding to see yourself build up technical documentation from scratch.

I have a track record of being a fast learner, switching from one field to another and quickly picking up required skills as demonstrated by my education trajectory. My undergraduate background is in English literature from one of Taiwan’s most reputable universities, *National Tsing Hua University (NTHU)*. After graduating from NTHU, I continued further studies in the UK at the prestigious *The University of Warwick* and majored in International Relations and East Asian studies for my master's degree.

Back in high school, I graduated a semester earlier than all my peers from the International School of Manila in the Philippines during January instead of June. I spent the next six months cramming classical Chinese literature and poetry, needless to say, it was a huge transition from studying old English, such as Beowulf and Shakespeare's sonnets. This experience in adolescence has helped build up my resilience, and ability to learn things quickly and adapt to completely different environments.

Identifying as a global nomad, I grew up in several different countries and loved to learn about other people’s cultures and customs from a young age. This is especially helpful when working in multicultural environments, where I tend to adapt quickly. Because I’ve lived abroad for 18 years, I’m bilingual and business fluent in Chinese and English.

In my spare time, I try to hone my knowledge about best documentation practices, and polish coding skills (especially front-end related). I also like to draw and learn about visual design since I enjoy the process of creating text and visual content. My interest in visualization and arts has helped create helpful diagrams and illustrations for user guides and made the communication process with designers much smoother. You may also spot me working on some open-source project documentation during my free time.
